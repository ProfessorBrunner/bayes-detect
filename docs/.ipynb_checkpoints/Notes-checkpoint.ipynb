All the sampling methods used require that there are atleast a few number of points in the parameter space that may contain an object. This is required to effectively sample the space where an object might occur. If we don't take enough number of points we may end up with only the brightest object. The thumb rule I followed for various method are as follows.\n",

To use this, a flag is provided named \"STOP_BY_EVIDENCE\" in the config file. We can enable it and use this condition. The default value is set to 0.1(in log evidence).    "

The ratio between the brightest and the faintest objects shouldn't exceed 20-30. If the ratio is very high, as the sampling procedure proceeds the live points get replaced by the points belonging to the brightest object more often and this may lead to not getting sufficient samples from other areas to perform clustering. This problem has to be solved by exploring different ways to sample from a set of ellipsoids."
