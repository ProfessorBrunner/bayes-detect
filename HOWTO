How to use this
======

Almost every parameter is read from the config.ini file
Output is currently to the files/0 folder
Every file has to be run from the same level the folder is in otherwise the config file might not load correctly.

1. Image Generation
In the image_generator folder, there is a script image_generator.py
Running that will read the parameters for the image from config.ini and output it to the specified location

2. Running Sampling
In the nested_som folder, there is a script model_nest_som.py
Running this will load the image and run sampling on it.
This will generate various plots of the sampling and the sample which will all be stored in the output folder specified in config.ini.

3. Post Sampling Object Detection
In the post_sampling folder there is a ipython notebook splitter2.ipynb.
This loads the saved samples from part 2 and tries to recursively split on it.
